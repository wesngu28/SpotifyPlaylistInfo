# Spotify Playlist Info
A python script that I made to display some basic information about an inputed Spotify playlist. I made this to learn more python and learn the tkinter interface modules and pyinstaller. Makes use of the Spotipy library for the spotify api to serve information about playlists.

It was relatively simple to make but was a great learning experience for tkinter and pyinstaller, as well as getting familiar with API calls. The next step that I am working on is to convert this into a web app with a backend framework like Flask or Django and perhaps make it more functional and useful.

## Usage
Download or clone the repository and run the included exe file. Optionally, you could also run the PlaylistInfo.py script but there is no requirements file included.
